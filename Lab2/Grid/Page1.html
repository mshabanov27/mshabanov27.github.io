                <div style="font-size:x-large;">
                    Italian poet, prose writer, literary theorist, moral philosopher, and political thinker.</br> He is best known for the monumental epic poem La commedia, later named La divina commedia (The Divine Comedy).
                    Dante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy. His depictions of Hell, Purgatory and Heaven provided inspiration for the larger body of Western art and literature.
                    He is described as the "father" of the Italian language, and in Italy he is often referred to as il Sommo Poeta ("the Supreme Poet").

                Now I had grasp'd his tresses, and stript off</br>
                More than one tuft, he barking, with his eyes</br>
                Drawn in and downward, when another cried,</br>
                "What ails thee, Bocca?  Sound not loud enough</br>
                Thy chatt'ring teeth, but thou must bark outright?</br>
                "What devil wrings thee?"—"Now," said I, "be dumb,</br>
                Accursed traitor! to thy shame of thee</br>
                True tidings will I bear."—"Off," he replied,</br>
                "Tell what thou list; but as thou escape from hence</br>
                To speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib,</br>
                Forget not: here he wails the Frenchman's gold.</br>
                'Him of Duera,' thou canst say, 'I mark'd,</br>
                Where the starv'd sinners pine.'  If thou be ask'd</br>
                What other shade was with them, at thy side</br>
                Is Beccaria, whose red gorge distain'd</br>
                The biting axe of Florence.  Farther on,</br>
                If I misdeem not, Soldanieri bides,</br>
                With Ganellon, and Tribaldello, him</br>
                Who op'd Faenza when the people slept."

                The Divine Comedy, Italian La divina commedia, original name La commedia, long narrative poem written in Italian circa 1308–21 by Dante. It is usually held to be one of the world’s great works of literature. Divided into three major sections—Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso—the narrative traces the journey of Dante from darkness and error to the revelation of the divine light, culminating in the Beatific Vision of God.
                Dante is guided by the Roman poet Virgil, who represents the epitome of human knowledge, from the dark wood through the descending circles of the pit of Hell (Inferno). Passing Lucifer at the pit’s bottom, at the dead centre of the world, Dante and Virgil emerge on the beach of the island mountain of Purgatory.

                At the summit of Purgatory, where repentant sinners are purged of their sins, Virgil departs, having led Dante as far as human knowledge is able, to the threshold of Paradise. There Dante is met by Beatrice, embodying the knowledge of divine mysteries bestowed by Grace, who leads him through the successive ascending levels of heaven to the Empyrean, where he is allowed to glimpse, for a moment, the glory of God.

                The standard critical Italian edition of the poem, La commedia secondo l’antica vulgata (1966–67; rev. ed. 1994), was edited by Giorgio Petrocchi. Henry Boyd produced one of the early English-language translations of The Divine Comedy; it was published in 1802. Notable translations of the 20th and early 21st centuries include those by John D. Sinclair (1939–48), Dorothy L. Sayers and Barbara Reynolds (1949–62), Charles S. Singleton (1970–75), John Ciardi (1977), Allen Mandelbaum (1980–84), Robert M. Durling and Ronald L. Martinez (1996–2011), Robert and Jean Hollander (2000–07), and Robin Kirkpatrick (2006–07).
                Among translations of the poem’s individual sections, those by Robert Pinsky (Inferno, 1994), W.S. Merwin (Purgatorio, 2000), and Mary Jo Bang (Inferno, 2012) are notable.

                Dante, like most Florentines of his day, was embroiled in the Guelph–Ghibelline conflict. He fought in the Battle of Campaldino (11 June, 1289), with the Florentine Guelphs against Arezzo Ghibellines; then in 1294 he was among the escorts of Charles Martel of Anjou (grandson of Charles I of Anjou) while he was in Florence. 
                To further his political career, he became a pharmacist. He did not intend to practice as one, but a law issued in 1295 required nobles aspiring to public office to be enrolled in one of the Corporazioni delle Arti e dei Mestieri, so Dante obtained admission to the Apothecaries' Guild. 
                This profession was not inappropriate, since at that time books were sold from apothecaries' shops. As a politician, he accomplished little but held various offices over some years in a city rife with political unrest.
                Pope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (1 November, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. 
                A new Black Guelph government was installed, and Cante dei Gabrielli da Gubbio was appointed podestà of the city. In March 1302, Dante, a White Guelph by affiliation, along with the Gherardini family, was condemned to exile for two years and ordered to pay a large fine. Dante was accused of corruption and financial wrongdoing by the Black Guelphs for the time that Dante was serving as city prior (Florence's highest position) for two months in 1300.
                The poet was still in Rome in 1302, as the Pope, who had backed the Black Guelphs, had "suggested" that Dante stay there. Florence under the Black Guelphs, therefore, considered Dante an absconder.
                Dante did not pay the fine, in part because he believed he was not guilty and in part because all his assets in Florence had been seized by the Black Guelphs. He was condemned to perpetual exile; if he had returned to Florence without paying the fine, he could have been burned at the stake.
